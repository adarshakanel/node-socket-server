# Node.js Socket.io Server

Download Unity Socket.io Library from here [https://github.com/Rocher0724/socket.io-unity/releases]


In Unity, navigate to

```
Build Settings > Player Settings > Other Settings > Configuration
```

and change

```
Api Compatibility Level: .NET 4.x

Also, note that npm socket.io library only works with v2.x, instead of 3.x or higher.
